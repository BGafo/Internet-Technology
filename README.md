# Internet-Technology

These are the projects I wrote with a classmate during the Internet Technology class at Rutgers University.

Communication media; protocol layers, TCP/IP protocols, wireless protocols, high speed protocols, routing, and switching architectures.
Interprocess communication, client-server interaction, and socket programming.
Emerging trends and technologies such as high speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communication, wireless communication, and videoconferencing.
