This is a simple project intended to get you used to python, sockets, and the formalities of projects like readme and groups. This will be worth 1/3 of the future projects. This exercise will serve as the foundation for the upcoming programming project. A sample working client code is given to you in Client.py.  Your job is to write the corresponding Server code. The goal of the server is to get any string sent to it, reverse it and send it back to the client. Lastly it should then close gracefully when the client is done sending strings. A sample output and input file has also been provided.
