MY 1 first thought was, he lied in every word,	
  That hoary cripple, with malicious eye	
  Askance to watch the working of his lie	
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford	
Suppression of the glee, that purs’d and scor’d	        5
  Its edge, at one more victim gain’d thereby.	
 
What else should he be set for, with his staff?	
  What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare	
  All travellers who might find him posted there,	
And ask the road? I guess’d what skull-like laugh	        10
Would break, what crutch ’gin write my epitaph	
  For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,	
 
If at his counsel I should turn aside	
  Into that ominous tract which, all agree,	
  Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly	        15
I did turn as he pointed: neither pride	
Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,	
  So much as gladness that some end might be.	
 
For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,	
  What with my search drawn out thro’ years, my hope	        20
  Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope	
With that obstreperous joy success would bring,—	
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring	
  My heart made, finding failure in its scope.	
 
As when a sick man very near to death	        25
  Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end	
  The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,	
And hears one bid the other go, draw breath	
Freelier outside, (“since all is o’er,” he saith,	
  “And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;”)	        30
 
While some discuss if near the other graves	
  Be room enough for this, and when a day	
  Suits best for carrying the corpse away,	
With care about the banners, scarves and staves,	
And still the man hears all, and only craves	        35
  He may not shame such tender love and stay.	
 
Thus, I had so long suffer’d, in this quest,	
  Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ	
  So many times among “The Band”—to wit,	
The knights who to the Dark Tower’s search address’d	        40
Their steps—that just to fail as they, seem’d best.	
  And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?	
 
So, quiet as despair, I turn’d from him,	
  That hateful cripple, out of his highway	
  Into the path the pointed. All the day	        45
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim	
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim	
  Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.	
 
For mark! no sooner was I fairly found	
  Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,	        50
  Than, pausing to throw backward a last view	
O’er the safe road, ’t was gone; gray plain all round:	
Nothing but plain to the horizon’s bound.	
  I might go on; nought else remain’d to do.	
 
So, on I went. I think I never saw	        55
  Such starv’d ignoble nature; nothing throve:	
  For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!	
But cockle, spurge, according to their law	
Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,	
  You ’d think; a burr had been a treasure trove.	        60
 
No! penury, inertness and grimace,	
  In the strange sort, were the land’s portion. “See	
  Or shut your eyes,” said Nature peevishly,	
“It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:	
’T is the Last Judgment’s fire must cure this place,	        65
  Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.”	
 
If there push’d any ragged thistle=stalk	
  Above its mates, the head was chopp’d; the bents	
  Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents	
In the dock’s harsh swarth leaves, bruis’d as to baulk	        70
All hope of greenness? ’T is a brute must walk	
  Pashing their life out, with a brute’s intents.	
 
As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair	
  In leprosy; thin dry blades prick’d the mud	
  Which underneath look’d kneaded up with blood.	        75
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,	
Stood stupefied, however he came there:	
  Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!	
 
Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,	
  With that red, gaunt and collop’d neck a-strain,	        80
  And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;	
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;	
I never saw a brute I hated so;	
  He must be wicked to deserve such pain.	
 
I shut my eyes and turn’d them on my heart.	        85
  As a man calls for wine before he fights,	
  I ask’d one draught of earlier, happier sights,	
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.	
Think first, fight afterwards—the soldier’s art:	
  One taste of the old time sets all to rights.	        90
 
Not it! I fancied Cuthbert’s reddening face	
  Beneath its garniture of curly gold,	
  Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold	
An arm in mine to fix me to the place,	
That way he us’d. Alas, one night’s disgrace!	        95
  Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.	
 
Giles then, the soul of honor—there he stands	
  Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.	
  What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.	
Good—but the scene shifts—faugh! what hangman hands	        100
Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands	
  Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!	
 
Better this present than a past like that;	
  Back therefore to my darkening path again!	
  No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.	        105
Will the night send a howlet of a bat?	
I asked: when something on the dismal flat	
  Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.	
 
A sudden little river cross’d my path	
  As unexpected as a serpent comes.	        110
  No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;	
This, as it froth’d by, might have been a bath	
For the fiend’s glowing hoof—to see the wrath	
  Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.	
 
So petty yet so spiteful All along,	        115
  Low scrubby alders kneel’d down over it;	
  Drench’d willows flung them headlong in a fit	
Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:	
The river which had done them all the wrong,	
  Whate’er that was, roll’d by, deterr’d no whit.	        120
 
Which, while I forded,—good saints, how I fear’d	
  To set my foot upon a dead man’s cheek,	
  Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek	
For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!	
—It may have been a water-rat I spear’d,	        125
  But, ugh! it sounded like a baby’s shriek.	
 
Glad was I when I reach’d the other bank.	
  Now for a better country. Vain presage!	
  Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage	
Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank	        130
Soil to a plash? Toads in a poison’d tank,	
  Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage—	
 
The fight must so have seem’d in that fell cirque.	
  What penn’d them there, with all the plain to choose?	
  No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,	        135
None out of it. Mad brewage set to work	
Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk	
  Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.	
 
And more than that—a furlong on—why, there!	
  What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,	        140
  Or brake, not wheel—that harrow fit to reel	
Men’s bodies out like silk? with all the air	
Of Tophet’s tool, on earth left unaware,	
  Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.	
 
Then came a bit of stubb’d ground, once a wood,	        145
  Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth	
  Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,	
Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood	
Changes and off he goes!) within a rood—	
  Bog, clay, and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.	        150
 
Now blotches rankling, color’d gay and grim,	
  Now patches where some leanness of the soil’s	
  Broke into moss or substances like thus;	
Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him	
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim	        155
  Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.	
 
And just as far as ever from the end,	
  Nought in the distance but the evening, nought	
  To point my footstep further! At the thought,	
A great black bird, Apollyon’s bosom-friend,	        160
Sail’d past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penn’d	
  That brush’d my cap—perchance the guide I sought.	
 
For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,	
  Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place	
  All round to mountains—with such name to grace	        165
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.	
How thus they had surpris’d me,—solve it, you!	
  How to get from them was no clearer case.	
 
Yet half I seem’d to recognize some trick	
  Of mischief happen’d to me, God knows when—	        170
  In a bad perhaps. Here ended, then,	
Progress this way. When, in the very nick	
Of giving up, one time more, came a click	
  As when a trap shuts—you ’re inside the den.	
 
Burningly it came on me all at once,	        175
  This was the place! those two hills on the right,	
  Couch’d like two bulls lock’d horn in horn in fight,	
While, to the left, a tall scalp’d mountain … Dunce,	
Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,	
  After a life spent training for the sight!	        180
 
What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?	
  The round squat turret, blind as the fool’s heart,	
  Built of brown stone, without a counter-part	
In the whole world. The tempest’s mocking elf	
Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf	        185
  He strikes on, only when the timbers start.	
 
Not see? because of night perhaps?—Why, day	
  Came back again for that! before it left,	
  The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:	
The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,	        190
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,—	
  “Now stab and end the creature—to the heft!”	
 
Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it toll’d	
  Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears	
  Of all the lost adventurers my peers,—	        195
How such a one was strong, and such was bold,	
And such was fortunate, yet each of old	
  Lost, lost! one moment knell’d the woe of years.	
 
There they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met	
  To view the last of me, a living frame	        200
  For one more picture! in a sheet of flame	
I saw them and I knew them all. And yet	
Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,	
  And blew “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.”

  MY 1 first thought was, he lied in every word,	
  That hoary cripple, with malicious eye	
  Askance to watch the working of his lie	
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford

  Its edge, at one more victim gain’d thereby.

As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair	
  In leprosy; thin dry blades prick’d the mud	
  Which underneath look’d kneaded up with blood.	        75
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,	
Stood stupefied, however he came there:	
  Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!	
 
Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,	
  With that red, gaunt and collop’d neck a-strain,	        80
  And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;	
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;	
I never saw a brute I hated so;	
  He must be wicked to deserve such pain.	
 
I shut my eyes and turn’d them on my heart.	        85
  As a man calls for wine before he fights,	
  I ask’d one draught of earlier, happier sights,	
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.	
Think first, fight afterwards—the soldier’s art:	
  One taste of the old time sets all to rights.	        90
 
Not it! I fancied Cuthbert’s reddening face	
  Beneath its garniture of curly gold,	
  Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold	
An arm in mine to fix me to the place,	
That way he us’d. Alas, one night’s disgrace!	        95
  Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.	
 
Giles then, the soul of honor—there he stands	
  Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.	
  What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.	
Good—but the scene shifts—faugh! what hangman hands	        100
Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands	
  Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!	
 
Better this present than a past like that;	
  Back therefore to my darkening path again!	
  No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.	        105
Will the night send a howlet of a bat?	
I asked: when something on the dismal flat	
  Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.	
 
A sudden little river cross’d my path	
  As unexpected as a serpent comes.	        110
  No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;	
This, as it froth’d by, might have been a bath	
For the fiend’s glowing hoof—to see the wrath	
  Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.	
 
So petty yet so spiteful All along,	        115
  Low scrubby alders kneel’d down over it;	
  Drench’d willows flung them headlong in a fit	
Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:	
The river which had done them all the wrong,	
  Whate’er that was, roll’d by, deterr’d no whit.	        120
 
Which, while I forded,—good saints, how I fear’d	
  To set my foot upon a dead man’s cheek,	
  Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek	
For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!	
—It may have been a water-rat I spear’d,	        125
  But, ugh! it sounded like a baby’s shriek.	
 
Glad was I when I reach’d the other bank.	
  Now for a better country. Vain presage!	
  Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage	
Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank	        130
Soil to a plash? Toads in a poison’d tank,	
  Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage—	
 
The fight must so have seem’d in that fell cirque.	
  What penn’d them there, with all the plain to choose?	
  No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,	        135
None out of it. Mad brewage set to work	
Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk	
  Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.	
 
And more than that—a furlong on—why, there!	
  What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,	        140
  Or brake, not wheel—that harrow fit to reel	
Men’s bodies out like silk? with all the air	
Of Tophet’s tool, on earth left unaware,	
  Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.	
 
Then came a bit of stubb’d ground, once a wood,	        145
  Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth	
  Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,	
Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood	
Changes and off he goes!) within a rood—	
  Bog, clay, and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.	        150
 
Now blotches rankling, color’d gay and grim,	
  Now patches where some leanness of the soil’s	
  Broke into moss or substances like thus;	
Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him	
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim	        155
  Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.	
 
And just as far as ever from the end,	
  Nought in the distance but the evening, nought	
  To point my footstep further! At the thought,	
A great black bird, Apollyon’s bosom-friend,	        160
Sail’d past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penn’d	
  That brush’d my cap—perchance the guide I sought.	
 
For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,	
  Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place	
  All round to mountains—with such name to grace	        165
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.	
How thus they had surpris’d me,—solve it, you!	
  How to get from them was no clearer case.	
 
Yet half I seem’d to recognize some trick	
  Of mischief happen’d to me, God knows when—	        170
  In a bad perhaps. Here ended, then,	
Progress this way. When, in the very nick	
Of giving up, one time more, came a click	
  As when a trap shuts—you ’re inside the den.	
 
Burningly it came on me all at once,	        175
  This was the place! those two hills on the right,	
  Couch’d like two bulls lock’d horn in horn in fight,	
While, to the left, a tall scalp’d mountain … Dunce,	
Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,	
  After a life spent training for the sight!	        180
 
What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?	
  The round squat turret, blind as the fool’s heart,	
  Built of brown stone, without a counter-part	
In the whole world. The tempest’s mocking elf	
Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf	        185
  He strikes on, only when the timbers start.	
 
Not see? because of night perhaps?—Why, day	
  Came back again for that! before it left,	
  The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:	
The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,	        190
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,—	
  “Now stab and end the creature—to the heft!”	
 
Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it toll’d	
  Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears	
  Of all the lost adventurers my peers,—	        195
How such a one was strong, and such was bold,	
And such was fortunate, yet each of old	
  Lost, lost! one moment knell’d the woe of years.	
 
There they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met	
  To view the last of me, a living frame	        200
  For one more picture! in a sheet of flame	
I saw them and I knew them all. And yet	
Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,	
  And blew “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.”

  MY 1 first thought was, he lied in every word,	
  That hoary cripple, with malicious eye	
  Askance to watch the working of his lie	
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford	
Suppression of the glee, that purs’d and scor’d	        5
  Its edge, at one more victim gain’d thereby.	
 
What else should he be set for, with his staff?	
  What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare	
  All travellers who might find him posted there,	
And ask the road? I guess’d what skull-like laugh	        10
Would break, what crutch ’gin write my epitaph	
  For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,	
 
If at his counsel I should turn aside	
  Into that ominous tract which, all agree,	
  Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly	        15
I did turn as he pointed: neither pride	
Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,	
  So much as gladness that some end might be.	
 
For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,	
  What with my search drawn out thro’ years, my hope	        20
  Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope	
With that obstreperous joy success would bring,—	
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring	
  My heart made, finding failure in its scope.	
 
As when a sick man very near to death	        25
  Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end	
  The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,	
And hears one bid the other go, draw breath	
Freelier outside, (“since all is o’er,” he saith,	
  “And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;”)	        30
 
While some discuss if near the other graves	
  Be room enough for this, and when a day	
  Suits best for carrying the corpse away,	
With care about the banners, scarves and staves,	
And still the man hears all, and only craves	        35
  He may not shame such tender love and stay.	
 
Thus, I had so long suffer’d, in this quest,	
  Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ	
  So many times among “The Band”—to wit,	
The knights who to the Dark Tower’s search address’d	        40
Their steps—that just to fail as they, seem’d best.	
  And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?	
 
So, quiet as despair, I turn’d from him,	
  That hateful cripple, out of his highway	
  Into the path the pointed. All the day	        45
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim	
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim	
  Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.	
 
For mark! no sooner was I fairly found	
  Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,	        50
  Than, pausing to throw backward a last view	
O’er the safe road, ’t was gone; gray plain all round:	
Nothing but plain to the horizon’s bound.	
  I might go on; nought else remain’d to do.	
 
So, on I went. I think I never saw	        55
  Such starv’d ignoble nature; nothing throve:	
  For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!	
But cockle, spurge, according to their law	
Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,	
  You ’d think; a burr had been a treasure trove.	        60
 
No! penury, inertness and grimace,	
  In the strange sort, were the land’s portion. “See	
  Or shut your eyes,” said Nature peevishly,	
“It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:	
’T is the Last Judgment’s fire must cure this place,	        65
  Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.”	
 
If there push’d any ragged thistle=stalk	
  Above its mates, the head was chopp’d; the bents	
  Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents	
In the dock’s harsh swarth leaves, bruis’d as to baulk	        70
All hope of greenness? ’T is a brute must walk	
  Pashing their life out, with a brute’s intents.	
 
As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair	
  In leprosy; thin dry blades prick’d the mud	
  Which underneath look’d kneaded up with blood.	        75
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,	
Stood stupefied, however he came there:	
  Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!

  And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;	
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;	
I never saw a brute I hated so;	
  He must be wicked to deserve such pain.	
 
I shut my eyes and turn’d them on my heart.	        85
  As a man calls for wine before he fights,	
  I ask’d one draught of earlier, happier sights,	
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.

  One taste of the old time sets all to rights.	        90

  Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.
